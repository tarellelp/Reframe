      <h2>Reframing The Homeless Crisis in Seattle, WA</h2>
        <div id="history">
          <h3>Historical Frame of Reference</h3>
            <p>Historically, homelessness is not a new to Seattle‚Äîbetween 1880-1890 Seattle experienced a massive economic boom with an influx of industry, population and economy, which brought fortune, and misfortune: 1909 records note Seattle had a rat infested shacktown consisting of 105 hovels, two of which were functioning grocery stores. In 1937, Public Housing was created due to the 1937 Housing Act which gave local jurisdictions access to federal funding if they were willing to build and manage affordable housing. However, this was not a quick fix to the shacktowns of Seattle as recorded by a shacktown resident, Byrd Kelso, in 1938. Kelso conducted a census and found 22,204 shacks in Seattle and 64 percent of the shack residents were single men. Although there is no notation for Kelso‚Äôs method for recording, the number was deemed accurate and cited in multiple newspapers at the time who debate the reasoning for Seattle having such a high population of homeless residents, ‚ÄúEvery American city of any size has long had a shacktown of sorts. In coastal cities the tendency has been toward the waterfront; in the interior, shacktown usually nestles by the riverside or will be found on ‚Äòthe other side of the tracks.‚Äô Seattle, with both salt and fresh waterfronts, affords unusual facilities for shacktown development.‚Äù</p>
           <p>The Seattle Housing Authority formed in the late 1930s and worked to complete the Yesler Terrace Housing Project which was opened 561 units in 1941. To pause for a    moment in the synopsized timeline of homelessness in  Seattle‚Äôs history, we will look at the 2018 All Home survey: the Yesler Terrace is located in Census Tract 91 which is experiencing exponential growth in homelessness from 2017-2018 there were a recorded 105 homeless people of a total population of 3016 people. The Historical roots of homelessness in this area are not coincidental, in part for the reasons speculated upon by the local news papers as stated above. Continuing on, in 1941 the Waterfront shacktown (Yesler Terrace area) was burned down and the Inter Bay shacktown was burnt in May of 1942. The burnings of these two shacktowns were to make space for docks for an increased U.S. Naval presence during WWII. It is speculated that the homeless population of Seattle also dropped significantly during the early 1940‚Äôs due to the increase in industry and jobs to supply the demands of the war effort. Homelessness was kept at bay with the affluent post war economy of the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs until the recession of the late 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs during the Cold War era. The historical underpinnings for homelessness in Seattle are important for understanding the current situation‚Äîthere has never been a successful system applied for rehousing the homeless of Seattle, it was WWII that neutralized the homeless population along with the fires and the demand for naval infrastructure, not the city of Seattle. Also, the geographic locations of homeless people in the Seattle area have not moved in over 100 years, only changed in appearance‚Äìshacktowns have transformed into tent cities. The Austrian architect Adolf Loos exclaims in his essay Ornament and Crime, ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] Set a whole city on fire, set the entire Empire alight and everyone will wallow in money and wealth.‚Äù Loos‚Äôs claim is based on a need for rapid change to support industry and that industry being at the mercy of style which is dictated by the want of the consumer in the capitalistic marketplace. Due to the fact that Loos‚Äôs idea to burn down a [part] city to produce new wealth is based on change, the positive change can only be temporary, as is the nature of change.</p>
      <div id="Framing the Current Crisis">
          <p> The current situation was established in 2015 when Mayor Ed Murray declared a ‚Äústate of emergency‚Äù due to homelessness. At the time 45 people had died on the streets of Seattle in the past year and 3000 children in the public schools were homeless. Murray was calling on support from the federal government which would give the city more administrative authority and financial backing. However, this was truly the tip of the iceberg. The current state of homelessness in Seattle under Mayor Jenny Durkan is increasingly dire, as shown in the annual report put out by All Homes Count Us In Seattle homeless survey. The findings of All Homes survey help us identify key demographics of the homeless population which link to causations of homelessness. Figure 13 displays the age demographic of homeless people in Seattle from 2017-2019. A few things can be learned from this chart in conjunction with other sources: that people 18-24 year of age make up almost a quarter of the homeless population in Seattle. If one should look at the foster care system in Seattle they will note that there is no system in place for youths after they age out of the system. According to All Homes findings one in five responders to the Count Us In survey have a foster care history. While the Seattle Times reports that, ‚Äúmore that a third of Washington‚Äôs foster kids become homeless after leaving care.‚Äù The foster care system‚Äôs short comings, and nonexistence support to participants who age out of the system, is only one possible causation for the young population of homeless people in Seattle. Another causation being extreme increase in rent. Similarly to the economic boom of the late 1800‚Äôs Seattle is experiencing wealth like never before with the creation of Amazon. Other Company‚Äôs such as Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks, and T-Mobile are top earners and employers for the city of Seattle. While new wealth is being discovered in the city at unprecedented rates, rent prices are rising higher than ever before and the city is also growing. The All Homes survey found that eight percent of homeless people were priced out of their apartments.  The City of Seattle claims rent prices have increased 57 percent over  the last six years and 47 percent of house holds in the Seattle metro area are ‚Äúhousing cost burdened.‚Äù However, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel in the spring of 2019, finally, the increase in rent prices are tapering off according to the Seattle times. There is a large wave of luxury apartments flooding the market in the Seattle Metro area where approximately 17,450 new apartments were built in 2018, or 48 apartments per day. Out of all the apartments in the city, about ten percent of them remain empty and rental rates have only increased by less than one percent from winter to spring in2019. While finance is undeniably part of the issue of homelessness it cannot be the core underpinning to the homeless crisis. </p>
          <p>There was over $1 billion spent on the homeless population of Seattle in 2018; if the issue was purely financial, there would surely be a reasonable solution by spending $1 billion amongst the recorded 12,112 homeless individuals in Seattle in 2018. $1 billion divided by 12,112 individuals is approximately $82,562.74 per individual. As a point of reference, the average income of a public high school teacher in Seattle is $66,401 as of September 26th, 2019. This oversimplification and comparison of numbers does serve to back-up one of the statements made by KOMO4 in their special report, Seattle is Dying. KOMO4 voiced that ‚Äúthe more money we throw at the problem the worse it gets.‚Äù Another causation of homelessness for  multiple demographics in the Seattle area is mental illness and drug use as shown in Figure 17 which was recorded by All Homes Count Us In survey. While the All Homes survey records only 32-36 percent of homeless individuals characterizing themselves as abusing drugs, an article by City Journal states that, ‚Äú80 percent of the homeless suffer from drug and alcohol addiction and 30 percent suffer from serious mental illness, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.‚Äù The Seattle Police Department conquers that the problem lies with drug abuse, but they go on to say that it is their inability to enforce authority over civil infractions and misdemeanors which affords the continual usage and selling of opioids in the open air. In the past civil misdemeanors such as public urination would be a $27 fine, and if the fine was not payed it would be a criminal charge. However, the attorney‚Äôs office stopped filling misdemeanors and civil infractions, which have stripped police of public authority and led to police ceasing to write tickets in the first place. The moral of the Seattle Police Department is at an all time low because they feel strangled by the bureaucratic nonsense which retrains them from doing their jobs properly, and now, with passion. The consequence of the police being restricted by the city from being law enforces is that opioid  such as methamphetamines, crack cocaine, and heroin has become for all intents and purposes legal to poses if one possesses three grams or less. For a reference point, three grams of heroin is equal to 30 doses. Now, on the streets of Seattle a criminal amount of an opioid substance is 20 grams. Drug dealers have accommodated these new terms and simply carry less on their person at any given time and are able to avoid being penalized by the fraught system. In 2018 Uwajimaya, a well established international food market, reportedly called the police 599 times, and only 8 of those calls ended in prosecutions.</p>
          <p>Arresting one‚Äôs way out of a drug crisis is surely not the answer. However, there is a shining example of rehabilitation in the state of Rhode Island which Seattle should look to. First and foremost the police in the state of Rhode Island are able to enforce authority over misdemeanor crimes. Once an offender is in the is in the Rhode Island Department of Corrections system due to a drug related crimes or issues they are able to participate in Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program which is directed by Dr. Jennifer Clark. The program gives participants the option to choose between three opioid blocking drugs, Mthadone, Suboxone, or Vivitrol. The MAT program also enlists individual and group therapy. Program  coordinators say that the opioid blocking drugs bring patients to a physical place where they can begin to do psychological work. After a prisoner leaves the Rhode Island Department of Corrections they are not dropped on the street, but provided for with their medications and therapy through Codac, a privately outsorced company. The MAT program has seen s 93 percent follow up rate of former drug abusers in the community. One former addict, Michael Manfredi, who was addicted since he was 15, was thankful for his arrest and continuing involvent in the MAT program because he said he otherwise would have likely overdosed and died. </p>

        <h3>Power: A Narrative Within The Frame</h3>
           <p>For many opioid abusers their trajectory points towards death or arrest. While this is the case for opioid users, arrest can have many rehabilitating and positive outcomes. However, the socialist government of Seattle has created its own narrative of what compassion means ‚Äì they call it compassion for all, but what it really is, is an inability to give thoughtful and tough love when necessary. It is hard to be compassionate and loving to our neighbors, but the answer is obviously not to allow a neighbor to dwell aimlessly in filth. Yet, this is the cop out option Seattle City Council is taking and it is perpetuating their narrative of ‚Äúcompassion‚Äù for all which in turn propels their success amongst their socialist party. The Seattle city council calls out large companies such as Amazon for not doing their part in abolishing homelessness, but as we have already established, homelessness is not purely a financial issue. It is a drug issue that is not able to be properly controlled by the police. The misinformation via the false narrative told by the Seattle City Council is the greatest detriment to the homeless population. It keeps the power structure at the status quo by inflating the power of the city government, deflating the power of the police, and empowering a subculture of underground, unregulated, and untaxed opioid trade that is detrimental to a class of citizens that are not being held accountable to any standard, but imposing upon other and most importantly themselves. </p>
          <p>The act of being homeless is not inherently bad or good outside of societal, political, or economic implications and ramifications, it simply exists. However, the context of the homeless community in Seattle does not simply exist, but exists in opposition to capitalist market place as a byproduct of the capitalist marketplace‚Äôs failure to seamless incorporate society, primarily pertaining to the labor force. Similarly, in a vacuum, power is not good or bad, it is neutral, like fire, and good or bad can be done with power. Eric Liu outlines six categories of power: physical force, like the police or military who enforce the law; wealth, which can purchase other forms of power like physical force; state action, such as government and bureaucracy; social norms, or what society considers to be acceptable within a margin or error; ideas, which can defy social norms, but are backed by wealth and people, and; numbers (i.e. people) who are needed to support an idea to have it come to fruition. Homeless dwellers in Seattle have become a threat to social norms with their growing numbers. The homeless community in Seattle is not heavily policed due to bureaucratic inefficiencies of the judicial system. Thus far, there is nothing bad in Seattle‚Äôs homeless community‚Äôs increase in power, only discomfort for the powers that be, as is the nature of change‚ÄîLiu notes that power is never static, and to assume so abdicates one‚Äôs power. Liu claims that one can learn to read power, and furthermore write power, which equates to citizenship‚ÄîLiu elaborates his claim that power and character combined are the essence of a good citizen. It has been established that the homeless community in Seattle holds an increasing amount of power primarily due to their numbers which support their opposition to social norms and their inability to be policed. Now what of their character? Is the homeless community of Seattle a community a group of good citizens that harness their power in a way which is bringing about positive change?</p>
          <p>On a communal level, the homeless population of Seattle is a disorganized kleptocracy infested with drug abuse and lawlessness who fails to acknowledge their stake in society, and therefore diminishes their own returns on socioeconomic investments that are widely demonstrated through the disintegration of public space. One-hundred percent of the top one-hundred Prolific Offenders of Seattle are all reported to be homeless or recently homeless and many of the crimes involve theft to pay for drugs. Mancur Olson describes in his book Power and Prosperity, ‚ÄúThe typical individual thief in a society of, say, a million people, bears about one-millionth of the loss to society that occurs because [their] crime makes society‚Äôs output less than it would otherwise be. [‚Ä¶] It is only society‚Äôs punishment of criminals that keeps crime from paying, and it is not always sufficient to inflict punishment. Though each criminal has a stake in the prosperity of society, that stake is so minuscule that the criminal ignores it:‚Äù Olson describes a criminal‚Äôs narrow interest in society which is similar to Seattle‚Äôs homeless Community‚Äôs disinterest in society. He also notes the element that keeps crime from occurring is the punishment of crime, or what Liu calls force. However, the police of Seattle have been stripped of their civic power and are unable to enforce the municipal laws which make the laws void due to their ineffectiveness. The disregard for the law and stake in society would not qualify as character that Liu describes which is a necessary element of a good citizen. Therefore, it is fair to say that the homeless community of Seattle are not good citizens, but merely citizens, and sometimes bad citizens. 
          </p>
          <p>Yet, just because one is a bad citizen does not mean that one is an inherently bad person‚Äîthe confusion on the moral implications of homelessness in relation to society as a whole exists on the level of the individual. The individual homeless constituent of Seattle has the opportunity to interact with people of other social classes in public space. These spaces that are enclosed by architectural parameters can magnify the social and cultural difference between the homeless individual and the housed individual of Seattle. The frame of the room provided by architectural public space gives context to an interaction, which heightens awareness of the housed individual to abnormalities that compete with social normalcy where consistency in types of interactions are baseline expectations which are socially not to be strayed from within a margin of error that in accordance with the [architectural] space.</p>
      <div id="architecture">
        <h3> The Visual Frame</h3>
        <h4> Does An Image = Truth?</h4>
          <p>The homeless community in Seattle cannot be said to have an innate tendency toward good or evil more than another individual human, and furthermore is not an individual   detriment to Seattle‚Äôs society because of innate character traits. It is the public perception of a housed and tax paying resident of Seattle is not able to perceive a homeless person‚Äôs unique identity because it is not adhered to an architectural space. An architectural space implies use which allows one to infer objective qualities about the user of a given architectural space. For example, a person walking into parking garage most likely knows how to drive or has access to a car. These assumptions are stereo types, but stereotypes are inherent to culture because there is a precent for them. Humans seek to understand one another on both primitive and cognitive levels. Because the homeless community of Seattles exists in an imperfectly free world, where citizens sacrifice part of their freedoms for protection issued by the government, there is an expectation for all citizens to participate in equal sacrifice of their freedoms via taxation to provide services such as public space. Yet, the homeless community of Seattle does not relinquish their perfect freedom, but generally benefit from the taxes and sacrifices of freedom of other tax payers (e.g. the homeless community of Seattle is protected has a right to use public spaces). The homeless community‚Äôs use of public space attaches their identity to the public space‚Äôs architectural forms and alters the use of public space for both the homeless community and others.</p>
          <p>Spaces like the Seattle Public Library shine a glaring light on the homeless population in relation to Seattle‚Äôs functioning (i.e. tax paying and voting) society. The library was conceived of by renown architect, Rem Koolhaas, and author of Junkspace. Koolhaas argues that the last public space is the store, and in the 21st century age of neoliberalism one defines themselves as their purchases. Koolhaas asserts that, ‚Äú‚ÄòIdentity‚Äô is the new junk food for the dispossessed, globalization‚Äôs fodder for the disenfranchised‚Ä¶‚Äù and he goes onto declare that, ‚ÄúThe cosmetics is the new cosmic‚Ä¶‚Äù Therefore, if we are defined by our cosmetic identities and purchases due to a capitalist marketplace set in an era of neoliberalism, our cosmetic identities of homeless and housed, especially in the setting of architectural public space, such as a library, are in visually contrast with another with creates social conflict. Karl Marx‚Äôs conflict theory states that such conflict can be a function of society to maximize an individual‚Äôs or group‚Äôs benefits via the state of, ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] ongoing conflict to due competition for scarce resources.‚Äù It also notes that order is not kept by conformity, but by domination. If homelessness occurs because of one‚Äôs right to pursue individual wealth which is enabled by the capitalist market place‚Äîit is perpetuated by the neoliberalist social perspective towards economics and masked by the moralistic political narrative of the Seattle City Council.</p>
          <p>The ability to paradoxically view the issue of homeless on an individual and communal level allows one to objectively perceive the the pitfalls of the groups interaction with society as a whole whilst still maintaining an appreciation for the individual. ‚ÄúOutcasts are created by a public perception of guilt‚Äùsays local Seattle resident, Connor Wing. One must have a  critical socioeconomic view and acknowledging homelessness as a byproduct of the capitalist marketplace and its failure to produce benefits to all of society due to its competitive nature outlines in conflict theory. Lastly, the way forward with the homeless crisis in Seattle is to simultaneously note the criminality and drug abuse that is in accordance with homelessness and address rehabilitation through state funded programs like the penal system whilst paradoxically working to social decriminalize the aesthetic of the prison by using it as a tool rather than a punishment for all of society. One way of doing so is by identifying junkspaces like shopping malls and noting the prison like aspect to consumerism that boxes one in rather than liberates one to express one‚Äôs self outside of objectivism and subjects one to judge others by the same neoliberal standards.</p>
